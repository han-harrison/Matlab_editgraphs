# Matlab_editgraphs
Code to edit matlab graphs

Edit_graphs.m accepts .fig files and handles of open matlab figures and makes a set of edits to make graphs acceptable for publication. 
This was developed to make graphs for my thesis and new features will be added as I come across different properties of the graphs that I wish to control. 

The graphs are saved as .png and .pdf (and .fig if necessary) and uses the absolutely fantastic piece of code developed by altmany which can be found here https://github.com/altmany/export_fig which you will need to get the best out of this project.

One graph (1_saw_mu) is currently added to this project in all three file formats (.fig, .png and .pdf) so gives an idea of how this code formats graphs . Example code will be added shortly.
